                <h2>What is climate change?</h2> 
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns across the globe. While these changes can occur naturally, scientists have found that human activities, particularly over the last century, have significantly accelerated this process.</p>

                <h2>What is causing it?</h2>
                <p>The primary driver of modern climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases are released through activities like burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. As a result, the planet is warming at an unprecedented rate, leading to a variety of serious consequences.</p>

                <h2>What are the effects on the environment?</h2>
                <p>You might have noticed changes in weather patterns over the years, such as hotter summers, more intense storms, or unpredictable seasons. These are all connected to climate change. Rising global temperatures are causing polar ice to melt, which contributes to higher sea levels and threatens coastal communities. Additionally, extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe, disrupting lives, agriculture, and ecosystems. For older generations, it may feel like the stable climate you grew up with is shifting, and that’s because it is.</p>

                <h2>What can we do about it collectively?</h2>
                <p>Addressing climate change requires collective action, from individuals to governments. Simple steps, like using energy-efficient appliances, reducing waste, and supporting sustainable practices, can make a difference. However, larger systemic changes, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources and protecting natural habitats, are also crucial. While the topic can feel overwhelming, understanding climate change is the first step toward taking meaningful action to protect the planet for future generations. By working together, we can mitigate its impacts and create a healthier, more sustainable world.</p>
